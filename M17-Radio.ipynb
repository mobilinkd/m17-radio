    "\n",
    "## Design Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary design goal is to have a working, inexpensive radio that will\n",
    "allow users to quickly start experimenting with M17 over the air.  A\n",
    "secondary design goal is to have a base for extending the work to a more\n",
    "full-featured design in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Required Features\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary purpose for the initial work is M17 development.\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. M17 transceiver\n",
    " 1. Great usability for M17\n",
    " 1. Easily reprogrammable firmware\n",
    " 1. Developer-friendly diagnostic interface\n",
    "\n",
    "### Nice to Have Features\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondary goals, through a phase 2 release, is to make a commercially\n",
    "desirable product for radio amateurs.\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. Analog FM capable\n",

    " 1. Network capable (make it a hotspot or iGate)\n",
    " 1. GPS capable\n",
    " 1. Data modem\n",
    "\n",
    "## Plan Outline\n",
    "\n",
    "Like all initial plans this is subject to change.  It should also be noted\n",
    "that portions of this plan have already been executed before it was being\n",
    "documented here, so this just serves as a historical record.  Most of these\n",
    "ideas have been discussed on the M17 Discord channels.\n",
    "\n",
    "The working plan is to use an existing radio design, using just the frame,\n",
    "case, user interface, battery and accessories of the radio so that these\n",
    "items do not need to be re-invented.  The RF board will be removed, and\n",
    "the mechanical layout reverse engineered.  A new RF board will be created\n",
    "to be a replacement.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is that an M17 experimenter will be able to buy an inexpensive\n",
    "radio, disassemble it, replace the RF board with an M17 RF board and start\n",
    "using M17.\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. Define the HT requirements.\n",
    " 1. Identify a suitable inexpensive HT.\n",
    " 1. Purchase and verify that the radio will meet our needs.\n",
    " 1. Reverse engineer the mechanical design.\n",
    " 1. Design a suitable RF replacement board.\n",
    " 1. Build the RF replacement board.\n",
    " 1. Test the RF replacement board.\n",
    " 1. Expect at least one revision board.\n",
    " 1. Build a small batch of boards.\n",
    " 1. Distribute boards to core M17 developers.\n",
    " \n",
    "The ultimate goal is to have a flexible radio that is a useful and commercially\n",
    "viable product, supporting both M17 and analog FM modes."

    " 1. Phillips PH0 screwdriver\n",
    " 1. [X-Key Repair Tool](https://amzn.to/3xwq5KV)\n",

    " 1. Collect the plastic sleeve around the flashlight that will fall out.\n",
    " 1. Disconnect the FPC from the RF board. This FPC connects the RF board to the front panel board.\n",

    "## Board Mechanical Design\n",
    "\n",
    "The next major project is to reverse engineer just the mechanical aspects of the\n",
    "PCB.  Upon inspection, there are some interesting elements.  The RF board has springs\n",
    "on it which are used to connect the ground plane with that of the UI board.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the key items we need:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. Board outline\n",
    " 1. Screw hole placement\n",
    " 1. Ground springs location\n",

    "# PCB Design\n",
    "\n",
    "The first stage of this is to design something that \"just works\" for initial development.\n",
    "The RF side does not need to be great.  We can forego the PA for now.  The assumption\n",
    "is that initial development will be done in a lab with lab equipment or with a hotspot.\n",
    "We do want to have proper filtering of the output signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "A follow-on design with an RF stage with PA sections for 2m and 70cm would follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Power\n",
    "\n",
    "Power comes from a 7.4V battery.  This uses a 3-terminal connector.  There is a\n",
    "temperature sense line on the middle connector which appears to be unused on the\n",
    "schematic. This is not unusual.\n",
    "\n",
    "We just need to add some filtering/decoupling caps and a voltage regulator.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## RF Design\n",
    "\n",
    "Exploring two options at the moment.  One is to use an AT1846S chip, basing the RF\n",
    "design around the HamShieldMini.  I am fairly confident that the AT1846S will work\n",
    "if the design uses two-point modulation, modulating the VCTCXO and the mic port.\n",
    "\n",
    "The HamShieldMini is an OSHW design. \n",
    "\n",
    "The other option is to use the On Semi AX5043, following their application note on\n",
    "using that chip as an analog FM transceiver.\n",
    "\n",
    "[AND9313/D AX5043 Use as Analog FM Transceiver](https://www.onsemi.com/pub/collateral/and9313-d.pdf)\n",
    "\n",
    "The AX5045 appears to be a high-power version of the AX5043, putting out 23dBm.  The\n",
    "AX5045 would simplify the initial design considerably, since the PA could be avoided\n",
    "and one would only need a TX/RX switch, band switch and some filtering.  A follow-on\n",
    "design would just require adding a couple class E amplifiers and upgrading an\n",
    "RF switch to handle the higher power.\n",
    "\n",
    "The AX5243 is another version with a different pinout but should also be usable.\n",
    "\n",
    "It does not appear that the On Semi chips would require two-point modulation as they\n",
    "are designed for 4-FSK modulation.  We cannot use the built-in digital modulation\n",
    "modes because it only supports gaussian filtering.  M17 requires RRC filtering on\n",
    "both TX and RX.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, there are a number of clear advantages to using the AX5045 chip, including\n",
    "some around clocking discussed in the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "To simplify things at this point we are \n",
    "\n",
    "## Clocks\n",
    "\n",
    "We require accurate clocking for both the microcontroller and for the RF chip.  The\n",
    "accuracy of the clock on the RF chip determines the frequency accuracy of the radio.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to use a VCTCXO which is going to be voltage-adjustable via a dig-pot.\n",
    "This is required for the RF size for frequency accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are considering 3 options.\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. Separate TXCOs for RF and MCU. Only the RF chip needs to be a VCTXCO.\n",
    " 1. Single VXTCXO used by both RF and MCU.  The RF chips have specific requirements\n",
    "    for clock frequencies which may be incompatible with the needs of the MCU.\n",
    " 1. Single VXTCXO and a multi-channel frequency synthesize chip such as the\n",
    "    Si5351A.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Separate TCXOs\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the most expensive option as accurate TXCOs and especially VCTCXOs are\n",
    "somewhat expensive.  But it gives us the most flexibility in the design.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Shared VCTCXO\n",
    "\n",
    "We can feed the clock into the MCU. STM32 chips have an MCO which can output\n",
    "frequencies up to 25MHz.  This does, however, limit the frequencies that we\n",
    "can run the MCU at, since the RF chips will have more strigent clock requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "For baseband modulation and demodulation, we need to be able to run the MCU\n",
    "clock at some multiple of the symbol clock, 4800Hz.  This is possible with the\n",
    "On Semi part which use a 16MHz clock but not with the AT1846S.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Frequency Synthesizer\n",
    "\n",
    "We can feed a single clock into a frequency synthesis chip such as the Si5351A.\n",
    "This provides the utmost in flexibility.  It would also allow us to dispense with\n",
    "the digipot and use a simple TCXO.  The frequency compensation could be done\n",
    "entirely within the synthesizer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reality at the moment is that these inexpensive chips are now very hard to\n",
    "source due to the global chip shortage.\n",
    "\n",
    "These products have been taken ove by Skyworks Solutions from Silicon Labs.\n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.skyworksinc.com/en/Products/Timing/CMOS-Clock-Generators/Si5351A-B-GT\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Microcontroller & Baseband\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to start with an STM32H725.  The board is going to be designed to use\n",
    "an 144-pin part, which is *HUGE* and way more than what we need.  However, these\n",
    "are parts we have in hand and their is a global chip shortage at the moment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The STM32H725 has enough CPU power to handle UI control, baseband processing, and\n",
    "audio encoding/decoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Programming and Debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to be able to easily program the microcontroller and debug the firmware.\n",
    "The radio chosen does not have a USB port, nor is it practical to add a USB port\n",
    "to the case or frame.  There are options for this, but all of them require a\n",
    "significant amount of work.\n",
    "\n",
    "One option is to use the 3.5mm jack for USB.  Instead of a stereo jack, we would\n",
    "use a TRRS jack (a 4-pole jack).  There are existing standards for this.\n",
    "\n",

    "  </tr>\n",
    "</table>\n",
    "\n",
    "The Apple iPod Shuffle version is a reasonable choice for us.  We can use a standard\n",
    "Kenwood HT connector, which will normally short the sleeve and ring 2.  When 5V is\n",
    "present on the sleeve, we can switch to USB mode.  The major advantage here is that\n",
    "the adapters are readily available online and are very inexpensive (under 10USD).\n",
    "\n",
    "[3.5mm to USB Adapter for iPod Shuffle](https://amzn.to/3fJqALq)\n",
    "\n",
    "We do need to work out how best to switch between analog and digital on these\n",
    "wires.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analog Devices has an article on this topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.analog.com/en/analog-dialogue/articles/switching-in-usb-consumer-applications.html\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other Output\n",
    "\n",
    "We can add support for multiple serial interfaces.  We can support channel\n",
    "programming, Ethernet over USB turning it into a hotspot, data ports for\n",
    "use as a data modem, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "https://wiki.st.com/stm32mcu/wiki/USB_overview#CDC_Ethernet_Control_Model_-28ECM-29_Subclass\n",
    "\n",
    "These are all ripe for future development.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Audio Input\n",
    "\n",
    "The microphone is, somewhat surprisingly, built into the RF board and not into\n",
    "the UI board.  This means we will need to provide a microphone input on the M17\n",
    "RF board.\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial design does not need to support analog FM mode.  But the long goal\n",
    "is to include support for this mode.  To do this the radio needs to support audio\n",
    "filtering, pre-emphasis and limiting.  All of this can be done in the DSP unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Microphone\n",
    "\n",
    "The microphone on the M7 is a 6mm diameter by 5mm tall, through-hole component.  It\n",
    "has a silicone boot around it with an opening at the top.  This fits into a small\n",
    "round area molded into the front plastic case.  This puts the microphone very close\n",
    "to the small opening for the microphone on the case.  The rubber boot will provide\n",
    "some protection from dust and moisture.\n",
    "\n",
    "The STM32H7 has support for MEMS microphones that use pulse density modulation (PDM).\n",
    "These are relatively inexpensive and will make interfacing with the microcontroller\n",
    "much simpler.  A MEMS microphone with PDM output avoids the need for any analog circuitry.\n",
    "\n",
    "Putting a MEMS microphone on the PCB would move it about 4-5mm away from the opening\n",
    "on the case.  I'm not sure if that is a good idea, or if we would lose some of\n",
    "the moisture and dust protection provided by the current microphone and boot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Surface mount 5x6mm electret microphones can be found for around 0.022USD (2.2 cents)\n",
    "and will require amplification. MEMS modules are 2 orders of magnitude more expensive\n",
    "and require little to no support components.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now we will spec an electret microphone.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Audio Output\n",
    "\n",
    "Audio output is via speaker or speaker-mic.  The radio has a speaker built into\n",
    "the front case & UI board.  There is a speaker out line on the FPC connector.\n",
    "An audio switch controlled by a contact switch on the speaker-mic connector\n",
    "determines where the output audio is routed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Audio Amplifier\n",
    "\n",
    "The M7 uses a TDA8541 1W audio amplifier to drive the speaker and speaker-mic output.\n",
    "We can replicate this part of the audio circuitry.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it would be interesting to be able to provide \n",
    "\n",
    "## Kenwood Connector\n",
    "\n",
    "The Kenwood K-type connector uses a 3.5mm connector and a 2.5mm connector separated\n",
    "by 11mm on center.  The two connectors must be centered at the same height.  It is\n",
    "important when selecting jacks that these dimensional requirements can be met.\n",
    "\n",
    "From a mechanical standpoint, these connectors can be subjected to a lot of mechanical\n",
    "stress over time.  Surface mount connectors are not ideal unless the case is designed\n",
    "to reinforce the jacks.  This is not the case for the M7. Both jacks on the M7 RF\n",
    "board are through-hole types and this design decision should be carried through in\n",
    "the M17 board.\n"
